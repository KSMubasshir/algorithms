## Description
### Skyline
Given n rectangular buildings in a 2-dimensional city, computes the skyline of these buildings, eliminating hidden lines. 
The main task is to view buildings from aside and remove all sections that are not visible. 
#### Input
All buildings share common bottom and every building is represented by a pair (left, ht)
* left: is x coordinated on the left side (or wall).
* ht: is the height of the building.
#### Output
A skyline is a collection of rectangular strips. 
A rectangular strip is represented as a pair (left, ht) where left is x coordinate of the left side of strip and ht is the height of strip.<br/>
